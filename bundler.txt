My new gems / ruby environment strategy:

I'm now using rbenv to manage ruby.


I've configured bundle (using bundle config --global path vendor/bundler)
to install all gems in a local vendor directory.

Also, add an alias for bundle install to bundle install --standalone --binstubs bundle/bin
This adds binstubs in a local bundle/bin directory that sets the paths up
correctly so that you don't need to load bundler (i.e. bundle exec) and
you don't need to load bundler.


Strategy for gemfile dependency specification:
During initial development, keep as loose as possible.
At some point, you'll need to firm up the dependencies, so that once live,
you can control when gems are updated and test properly.

If developing a gem, things are different: you want it to work with as many
other gem versions as possible.
Assume that the gem is using semantic versioning, and use the lowest version
that contains the api features you need.
Only increase the requirement if a bug stops the gem from working.
