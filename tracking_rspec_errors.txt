Sometimes rspec can fuck up due to previous test side effects.
To identify this, any narrow down the problem, there are a couple of
things yoyu can do.
You can rspec directories.
> rspec spec/integration

Single specs
> rspec spec/integration/account_store_reactivate_spec.rb

You can change the format to help see where the error first occurs:
> rspec -f doc spec/integration/* | less

Or select the specs to run if you think you've found the culprit
rspec `find spec/integration/ -name '*rb' | grep -v create_spec`
