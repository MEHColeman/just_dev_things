# Ruby syntax notes

Things like `if account && account.owner && account.owner.address` or
`account.try(:owner).try(:address)` can now be replaced by
`account&.owner&.address`

The & safe operator only works for nil, not other falsey values. So there are
some subltle differences to take care of.

Similarly, `dig` tidies up
```
address = params[:account].try(:[], :owner).try(:[], :address)

# or

address = params[:account].fetch(:owner) { {} }.fetch(:address)
```
to
```
address = params.dig(:account, :owner, :address)
```
