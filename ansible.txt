Ansible is an agentless tool that lets you automate admin tasks on remote
machines via ssh.

You define all your configuration, installation, deployment and maintenance
steps in a yaml file. This can be re-used for different environments.


## Modules.
These are the scripts that do the work.
They are sent to the target machine, executed, and removed.

## Playbooks
These are the set of instructions that indicate what modules need to be
executed and on what machines
A play is a yaml specification that  specifies a group of target host machines,
the user that will execute the instructions, the tasks that need to be
executed, and the arguments that indicate how the tasks are run.

 playbook contains one of more plays.

## Inventory
The list of hosts that indicate what modules are executed where.

[webservers]
10.19.0.1
10.19.0.2

Ansible can also be used to replace the dockerfile to create docker
environments. These same playbooks can be used to also create an environment on
a cloud instance or bare metal machine.
