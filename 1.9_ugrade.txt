The more test coverage you have, the better!

Run all your ruby commands with
> ruby -w

Create a second gemset with a 1.9.3 suffix.
jruby 1.7.0 onwards defaults to 1.9. Ensure your .jrubyrc, or wherever
you specify the compatibility mode is set to the appropriate mode for
each dev environment. Also, your jvm will need to be greater than Java
7, update 2.
Update all the gems that need to be updated for 1.9.3 compatibility.

Try out one9 gem:

You can run one9 on the old gemset, make the changes, then switch to the new gemset to test.

You will need to upgrade mysql gem to mysql2!
Run the tests, upgrade the gems & plugins.

Tests will find many issues.
Encoding is a major change!
