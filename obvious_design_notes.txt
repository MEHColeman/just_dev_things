# Obvious Design Notes
Obvious tries to separate concerns and decouple the common MVC architecture.
Entities model application logic without the ORM functionality.
Actions are single-method objects.
Contracts are checks that data is as expected.

Jacks are conduits for data persistence and exchange (via plugs)

Delivery is entirely independent, and could be via cli, rails, sinatra, etc.
