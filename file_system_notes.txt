The *nix filesystem hierarchy standard

The wikipedia page is usually good enough: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
The full spec is here: http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html

You can also see `man hier`

/usr is for user installed stuff
(MacOS brew likes it here)
/local is for stuff that's installed manually, not with a package
manager.
/share is for non binary stuff
/etc is for configuration
